I am a full-stack software developer, collaborator and creator with experience in React, JavaScript, PostgreSQL, and test-driven development. As a logic enthusiast with a background in design, I love to contribute to the processes that drive an application while dreaming about style possibilities (always starting with fonts). I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate with diverse groups, as I find immense satisfaction in working together towards a common goal and learning more about myself on the way there.

I aim to find as much peace as possible in each moment, and my goal as a developer is to create applications that help others do the same.
